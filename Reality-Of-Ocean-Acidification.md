This article makes four main arguments regarding greenhouse gas emissions and ocean acidification, each appearing to be backed with scientific understanding. As a result, an initial glance makes it seem as though the author is making solid arguments against the conventional view of the negative effects of greenhouse gas emissions on ocean conditions. The author appears to be knowledgeable about the topic as he has worked for the IPCC in the past. Nevertheless, his work appears to clash with current IPCC claims.

The first argument states that there is little science that suggests ocean acidification will lead to the collapse of ocean shelled plants and animals, and that crustaceans, plankton, and other bottom of the food chain organisms will be benefited. However, there is little explanation for this, and it is not backed up with any references or statistics. Conversely, the IPCC AR5 Synthesis report states with high confidence that with the current pattern of CO2 emissions, there will be increases in ocean acidification that will strongly affect marine ecosystems (Pachauri, Mayer and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2015). It also contains specific statistics about how different pH levels pose risks to marine organisms. In summary, the first claim is difficult to deconstruct on its own, but provides insufficient evidence to stand up to contrary information in more reputable information.

The second point discusses how historically, the ocean has been much more acidic in the past and marine organisms will adapt now as they have before. As with the first claim, this point does not contain any references or citations to support it, yet the claim appears plausible. However, something that may disprove this is the fact that even if the oceans have been more acidic in the past, the Smithsonian Institute states oceans have not been acidifying at the same rate as they are today (Ocean Portal Team, 2018). This suggests that even though organisms may have adapted in the past, it does not guarantee that they may be able to today. 

The third statement of this claim is that acidification does not result in any harm when other variables are coupled for. Unlike the previous ones, this statement even cites an IPCC statement that there is no observational evidence of oceanic changes due to increased acidity. However, there is still no reference present so this is hard to verify. Regardless, such a claim runs contrary to recent IPCC reports which explore the severity of ocean acidification and the various negative effects it may have.

The final point mentions how the ocean conditions changing rapidly and the 0.1 change in pH that is mentioned in IPCC reports are simply “noise” as there are often much larger changes in oceanic conditions. Once again though, there is no citation or statistics given here to describe the natural variation of ocean conditions. This would make this point much more convincing, as it seems the author is trying to suggest that the 0.1 change in pH is minimal. However, given the logarithmic nature of the pH scale, the 0.1 drop in pH corresponds to a 26% increase in acidity, something that the author fails to mention but is mentioned by the AR5 synthesis report.
 
Nevertheless, the author does make use of scientific statements and in the conclusions cites a study that appears to demonstrate how certain marine organisms respond positively to the acidification of the ocean. The claims made are convincing and require further research to bring them into question. Even after conducting research into each of these claims, I have developed new perspectives on this aspect of climate change.
